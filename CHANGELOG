# 6.0

## General

+ Removed TypeScript typings (please help bring them back!).
+ Removed Browserify-specific shims. Serialization functionality is natively
  compatible with `@avro/types`.
+ Removed IDL support from `parse`.

## Types (@avro/types)

+ Renamed a few methods (the previous names are still available and will be
  deprecated in `6.1`):
  + `decode` to `binaryDecodeAt`
  + `encode` to `binaryEncodeAt`
  + `fromBuffer` to `binaryDecode`
  + `toBuffer` to `binaryEncode`
  + `compareBuffers` to `binaryCompare`
+ Added a `checkValid` method to check whether a value matches the type,
  producing actionable error messages.
+ Replaced `name()` method with `name` and `branchName` properties.
+ Removed `fingerprint`, `inspect`, and `random` methods.
+ Removed deprecated getters (`getValuesType`, `getSchema`, ...).
+ Replaced `fromString` (resp. `toString`) with `fromJSON` (resp. `toJSON`).
+ Removed `clone` options.
+ Updated `isValid` to reject unknown fields by default and renamed the
  `noUndeclaredFields` option to `allowUndeclaredFields`.

## Containers & streams (@avro/streams)

No changes.

## RPC services (@avro/services)

Overhauled the API: services are now more composable, RPCs are easier to
instrument, natively support promises, and much more. This functionality
requires `node>=7`.

## IDL parsing (@avro/idl)

+ Added a synchronous version of `assembleProtocol`: `assembleProtocolSync`.
+ Removed `readSchema`, and `readProtocol`.
